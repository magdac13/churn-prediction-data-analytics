In a bank an outflow of customers has been noticed for some time - that's about 16% over the past year. However, at this point no one has been able to identify the factors that may have caused this. As analysts, we have been engaged in this task in order to find the cause of the problem, based on which the next steps will be defined. Moreover, an additional result of the analysis is expected to be the selection of a group of customers against whom the bank should focus its efforts at this point to prevent their departure.

On the basis of the expertise of those who serve retail customers, the IT team has prepared a set of data that will serve us in further analysis.
